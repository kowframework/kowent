1. Implement joined queries
2. Implement entity labels
3. Implement extra properties
	=> Locale_Property
	=> Foreign_Key property
4. Test all the filtering facilities



Once this is finished I'll start yet another refactoring on KOW_View (remove all the unbounded_strings references in favour of streams).

With that finished I can code the brand new kowview-entities from scratch once again.
