1. database initialization
2. Implement entity labels
3. Implement extra properties
	=> Locale_Property
	=> Foreign_Key property (maybe it's not really needed... is it?)



Once this is finished I'll start yet another refactoring on KOW_View (remove all the unbounded_strings references in favour of streams).

With that finished I can code the brand new kowview-entities from scratch once again.
